# Deployment Guide for React Smart Image Uploader

This guide will walk you through the process of building, testing, and publishing your npm package, as well as strategies for community outreach.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Build the Package

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create the `dist/` folder with:
- `index.js` (CommonJS build)
- `index.esm.js` (ES modules build)
- `index.d.ts` (TypeScript declarations)

### 3. Test the Build

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
```

### 4. Update Package Information

Before publishing, update these fields in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "react-smart-image-uploader",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/react-smart-image-uploader.git"
  },
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/yourusername/react-smart-image-uploader/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/yourusername/react-smart-image-uploader#readme"
}
```

## Publishing to NPM

### 1. Create NPM Account

If you don't have an NPM account:
1. Go to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Verify your email

### 2. Login to NPM

```bash
npm login
```

Enter your NPM credentials when prompted.

### 3. Check Package Name Availability

```bash
npm view react-smart-image-uploader
```

If the package doesn't exist, you're good to go. If it does, choose a different name.

### 4. Publish the Package

```bash
npm publish
```

For scoped packages (recommended for first-time publishers):

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

### 5. Verify Publication

Check your package on NPM:
- Visit: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-smart-image-uploader`
- Test installation: `npm install react-smart-image-uploader`

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning

Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR** (1.0.0): Breaking changes
- **MINOR** (0.1.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (0.0.1): Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Publishing Updates

```bash
# Patch version (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
npm version patch
npm publish

# Minor version (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
npm version minor
npm publish

# Major version (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
npm version major
npm publish
```

## Community Outreach Strategy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Publishing Issues

1. **Package name already exists**
   - Choose a different name
   - Use a scoped package: `@yourusername/package-name`

   - Check TypeScript configuration
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Test build locally before publishing

3. **Permission errors**
   - Ensure you're logged into NPM
   - Check package ownership
   - Use `--access public` for scoped packages

### Getting Help
